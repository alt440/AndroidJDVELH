# AndroidJDVELH
Small game to get to know Android better

The files that I have added are located here:

main/java/com/example/jdvelhapp/ --> these are the files handling activities (also called views) except for IndexInArrayFollower which was meant to facilitate the manipulation of the index.

main/res/layout/ --> these are the files that show how the activities should look like. You can see them by clicking on the file and selecting the "Design" view instead of the text view. There is the drag and drop possibility from the "Design" view.

main/res/values/strings.xml --> this is where I added my strings.



Also note: I have created a file called notes.txt in "main/java/com/example/jdvelhapp/notes.txt". It contains a lot of lessons that I have learned to build Android applications. If you need any information, this is where you should start to look.
This main folder is the same folder as the one you can find on Android Studio (app/src/main). I just copied that folder here.
